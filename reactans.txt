7.
in React, functional components are written as plain JavaScript functions that return JSX,
 while class components are written using ES6 classes that extend React.Component.
Functional components are lightweight and use React Hooks (useState, useEffect) to handle state and lifecycle,
 whereas class components use the this.state object and lifecycle methods like componentDidMount().
Because functional components are simpler, faster, and easier to test, they are preferred in modern React development.

8. Why should React component names start with a capital letter?

React uses capitalization to identify custom components.
Example: <MyComponent /> is custom, while <div> is a built-in HTML tag.

9. Difference between JSX and plain JavaScript:

JSX is syntactic sugar for React.createElement().
It looks like HTML inside JS but compiles to JS objects.
const el = <h1>Hello</h1>;  // JSX

const el = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello');
